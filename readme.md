## Project Name :  ` Dr.DeAid`
`Dr. DeAid is designed to bring out a healthcare revolution by providing a platform for people, Doctors, Hospitals, and Healthtech Organizations.`

## Inspiration  üåê

Healthcare professionals must keep accurate patient health records. Additionally, these records must be shared between various healthcare organizations so that specialists can thoroughly analyze medical histories and prevent missing crucial information. Despite the availability of some web2-based apps, adoption of these systems is hampered by technical and legal barriers such as worries about performance and privacy. There is a potential that these documents will be falsified or altered.

----------

## What it does

Dr. DeAid was created using blockchain technology. We have three types of personas in this, namely User, Hospital, and Research Institution. The patient's medical records are stored on the blockchain so that they are not tampered with and can be used as references. The hospital (trusted party) is the one who creates the user's record. The research organization can conduct multiple studies on specific topics, and the data needed for the study is provided by the user. Because the user's documents are private to the user, the user has the option of granting access to the hospital or research institutions of his or her documents. By doing so, we protect the user's privacy.

## How we built it ‚öôÔ∏è

We divided this project into 3 major sections (frontend, backend & storage).  
We implemented

-   **Frontend**  with: HTML, CSS, ReactJs, Tailwind.  [Github](https://github.com/AnkitJaiswal26/PoweringSTEMHacks/tree/main/src)  
   -   **Backend**  with : Blockchain  [Github](https://github.com/AnkitJaiswal26/PoweringSTEMHacks/tree/main/src/Context)  
        
 -   **Storage**  : Web3.Storage, InterPlanetary File System(IPFS)

----------

## Challenges we ran into

Because we were new to this technology, the main challenge was creating a smart contract that included all of these features. The second challenge was to create a user interface for it, as well as decentralized storage to store all of the documents in IPFS.

----------

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üí™üèª

We are proud that we completed the project in the given time period along with all the features that we thought of at the start of the hackathon.

----------

## What we learned üìñ

-   Learn how to collaborate with the team using git.
-   Practical implementation of Blockchain in real work problems.
-   Establishing a connection between blockchain contract & our React App.
-   Working with ReactJS & Its Hooks.
-   Deal with Forms that accept the multitype Files.

## What's next for Dr. DeAid

We are thinking of adding some new personas such as insurance agencies, government agencies, etc. We are also thinking of converting this whole blockchain to a consortium blockchain in which every organization will have its own private blockchain independent from the main network so that its internal details won't be leaked to its competitors. We will also add ZK verification for every persona.
